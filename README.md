* Hacker news [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12079824) about circuit layout tools eg Eagle vs KiCAD vs Altium
* Charbax [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSt7ntanj2I) with guy designing circuit boards, who converts between Altium and Eagle into KiCAD - he seems to prefer KiCAD.

## Oscilloscopes
* [Digilent Analog Discovery 2 is a USB oscilloscope](http://store.digilentinc.com/analog-discovery-2-100msps-usb-oscilloscope-logic-analyzer-and-variable-power-supply/) allows users to measure, visualize, generate, record, and control mixed-signal circuits of all kinds.
* [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com) USB logic analyzer is faster (500msps vs 100) however the Digilent has a lot more features eg +- 25V
* [A novel chipset and architecture for portable oscilloscopes](http://www.eedesignnewseurope.com/news/novel-chipset-and-architecture-portable-oscilloscopes-0) - "Rigol Technologies has announced its Phoenix Oscilloscope chipset and the Ultravision II oscilloscope architecture to underpin its next generation of digital oscilloscopes."
